     The "bober kurwa" meme originated from a series of humorous videos featuring Polish men enthusiastically recording beavers while exclaiming "Kurwa BÃ³br," which translates to "f**k, a beaver." The earliest instances of this phrase can be traced back to YouTube videos from 2012 and 2014, where individuals would film beavers and use the phrase in an excited or comedic context23.
     The meme gained significant traction around 2017, particularly with a viral video by YouTuber Fred Pierwszy Wielki, where he humorously chased a beaver, leading to widespread sharing on platforms like iFunny in 2018. By 2023, the meme had further spread to TikTok, where various adaptations and remixes garnered millions of views, solidifying its place in contemporary internet culture
