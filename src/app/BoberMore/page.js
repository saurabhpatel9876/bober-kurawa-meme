    Most versions of the "Bober Kurwa" meme feature a picture of a beaver, often looking disheveled or in a weird, awkward pose. The expression on the beaver’s face usually conveys exhaustion, confusion, or surprise—perfectly matching the vibe of someone saying "kurwa" in real life. The image is overlaid with the text "Bober kurwa" (Beaver, f*ck), or a variation like "Bober says kurwa," humorously captioning the beaver’s emotions.
